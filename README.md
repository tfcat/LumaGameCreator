Luma Game Creator is comprised of three main applications:
* **Editor.** An editor that produces XML files containing all information about 
  the code, assets, and entities that a game created in Luma is comprised of.

* **Translator.** An executable that converts the editor's project files into a 
  single custom filetype which contains everything needed to run your game.

* **Core.** An executable that can read Luma's custom game filetypes. The 
  custom filetype will be embedded alongside the core executable so that your game can
  be easily distributed.


0.0.1 Core Roadmap
--------------------------------------------------------
0.0.1 result will:
* display a window adhering to settings in config.xml
* have unique objects that run/can run Lua code on creation and on every frame
* have a small API written in C++ which is accessible from Lua
* let objects draw shapes onto the screen
* let objects draw sprite assets onto the screen

Implement basic, unoptimised versions of all listed modules:
- [x] FileSystem (to-be virtual file system)
- [x] LuaManager
- [x] ObjectDatabase
- [x] LuaLibrary
- [ ] ConfigManager
- [ ] WindowManager
- [ ] AssetDatabase
- [ ] Engine (encapsulates all of the prior)

Data Types:
- [x] ObjectAsset
- [x] ConfigAsset
- [ ] ImageAsset

Game folder structure (for now):
```
📁
┕━ game.exe (our core executable)
┕━ data (in future, will be a single custom file)
	┕━ main.lua (all Lua logicstuffs. hard-coded in future?)
	┕━ config.xml (window config, general game settings etc)
	┕━ objects.xml
	┕━ objects.lua
	┕━ images.xml
	┕━ rooms.xml
	┕━ audio
