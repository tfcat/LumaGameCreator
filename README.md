Lumi Game Creator - version 0.0.1
--------------------------------------------------------
Lumi Game Creator will a fast, cross-platform
open-source solution for making 2D game prototypes.

Feel free to report bugs or ideas in issues!

Lumi Game Creator is comprised of three main applications:
* **Editor.** An editor that produces XML files containing all information about 
  the code, assets, and entities that a game created in Lumi is comprised of.

* **Translator.** An executable that converts the editor's project files into a 
  single custom filetype which contains everything needed to run your game.

* **Core.** An executable that can read Lumi's custom game filetypes. The 
  custom filetype will be embedded alongside the core executable so that your game can
  be easily distributed and ran on **any machine**.

Dependencies:
--------------------------------------------------------
* SDL2
* Lua5.3

Compiling Core Engine
--------------------------------------------------------

This project is built using the QtCreator IDE and qmake build system!

* Download the `SDL2` and `lua5.3` development libraries.
* Edit Core/engine.pro so that INCLUDEPATH/DEPENDPATH and LIBS point to your own include/lib directories.
* Open `Core.pro` in QtCreator with any valid configuration and Build!
* (Windows) Copy the SDL2.dll and Lua5.3.dll files into the build directory.
* Run from QtCreator

0.0.1 Core Roadmap
--------------------------------------------------------
0.0.1 result will:
* display a window adhering to settings in config.xml
* have unique objects that run/can run predefined Lua code on every frame
* let objects detect user input
* let objects draw sprites onto the screen
* let objects play sounds

Implement basic, unoptimised versions of all listed modules:
- [x] FileSystem (to-be virtual file system)
- [x] LuaLibrary

- [x] LuaManager
- [x] ConfigManager
- [x] WindowManager
- [x] InputManager
- [ ] RoomManager

- [x] ObjectDatabase
- [x] SpriteDatabase
- [x] AudioDatabase
- [x] BackgroundDatabase
- [x] RoomDatabase
- [x] TilesetDatabase

- [x] ObjectAsset
- [x] SpriteAsset
- [x] TextureAsset
- [x] HitboxAsset
- [x] AudioAsset
- [x] BackgroundAsset
- [x] RoomAsset
- [x] TilesetAsset
